## Game Title

Guess the flags of world drag and drop board game.

## Game Description/Objective

Drag and drop the country flags onto the correct grid board cell.

## Game Rules

A player needs to drag and drop each of the randomly displayed country flags onto the correct cell of the game board displaying the corresponding country name. A player needs to complete the game before the 30 second countdown timer reaches zero. If a player has more than three incorrect attempts, or runs out of time, the game is over.

## User Story

- I want to start the game to display the country flags and the corresponding country names in the game board cells.
- I want to clearly see all the country flags in play during the game.
- I want to clearly see all the cells on the board where the flags need to be dropped.
- I want to see how much time I have left remaining during the game in play.
- I want to be able to drag and drop a flag onto the correct cell on the board.
- I want to see a correct or incorrect message after I make a drop move.
- I want to see a congratulations message if I successfully complete the game.
- I want to be able to see how many flags I have got correct during the game (percentage game completed).
- I want to see how many incorrect attempts (out of three) I have left during the game in play.
- I want the game to show me the answers to the flags I got wrong at the end of the game, if I did not successfully complete the game.
- I want to be able to start a new game when the current game is over.
- Each time I play a new game I would like the flags to be randomly chosen and different to the previous game.

## Future Developments

- Add progressively more difficult levels. Such as where the flags get harder (the game starts with the most common/major nation flags and increasingly shows less widely recognised smaller nation flags), the timer gets shorter, more flags are displayed and less incorrect answers are accepted.
